# Wil21 Model UE Test Plugin  

This repository provides a UE plugin compatible with **UE version 5.3.0**, which includes the following features:  

- Integration of the **Wil21 model** fitting.  
- Computation is handled within a **compute shader** for improved efficiency.

## Results Demonstration  

The following images showcase the sky effects generated by the Wil21 model under different conditions:

- **Rows**:  
  - First Row: Sunrise effect.  
  - Second Row: Daytime sky with the sun already risen.  

- **Columns**:  
  - **Left**: Wil21 model effect with visibility set to 27.6.  
  - **Center**: Wil21 model effect with visibility set to 130.8.  
  - **Right**: Original UE sky atmosphere color reference.  

- Wil21 model resolution settings: **1024 Ã— 512**.

## Download a Dataset  

- Place the [Ground-level version (103 MB)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IflyFZTJxC_N298yXq_2GK4ycIsVJZk6/view?usp=sharing) of the model into the `Plugins/Wil21Model/Content` folder.  
  - This version is a smaller dataset that includes only a single (zero) observer altitude and does not include polarization.
